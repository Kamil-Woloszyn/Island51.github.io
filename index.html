                        <h1>Project Background</h1>
                        <p>The project aimed to enhance our Games Design and Development skills by building a group game, following the "Start with Nothing" theme using C++ and SFML. We chose a top-down 2D survival horror game.</p>
                        <p>We assigned roles, including stakeholder, architect, analyst, and developer, with a project manager overseeing progress. Agile methodology was chosen for flexibility, using GitHub for task organization.</p>
                        <p>Weekly meetings ensured continuous progress and task assignment. Time constraints emphasized the importance of weekly accomplishments. All meetings were documented and submitted for the assignment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide2">
                        <h1>Project instructions</h1>
                        <p>The player can move around using the WASD keys and aim using the mouse. The player can hit/shoot their weapon using the left mouse button.</p>
                        <p>The player can switch which weapon they have equipped using the numbers 1 to 5. The player can open their inventory using TAB and open crafting using Q.</p>
                        <p>In order to play tyhe game the player must save an SFML 2.6.0 File inside of the C:\ directory of their computer</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="slide3">
                        <h1>Project Demo</h1>
                        <p>Below is a YouTube link to the project demo of the game.</p>
                        <p>Starting off with their heads vikings mostly wore helmets to battle with few exceptions like the Jarls which were bascially the cheiftains and the kings. Then at the torso they usually wore leather tunics and/or fur coats but they wore armour to battle. Lastly the legs, vikings wore cloth trousers with a belt tied to their waist. Their boots were made from leather.</p>
                        <p>The video describes the different aspects of the game and goes a little bit into the coding of the game.</p>
